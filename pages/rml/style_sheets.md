Styles can be included in an RML document in three ways: included from an external style sheet, declared in the header, or declared inline inside a specific tag.

### External Style Sheets

Style sheets are included from an external source with the LINK tag. See [Link Element](documents.html#link-element).

### Header Style Information

RCSS can be included directly inside the header, with the STYLE tag.

*No attributes*

### Inline Style Declaration

RCSS can be declared directly inside an element with the style attribute.

*Attributes*

**style** = style (CN)

>This attribute specifies a list of RCSS properties to be applied to the current element.
