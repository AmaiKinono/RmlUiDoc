status: deprecated
status-desc: datagrid has been deprecated in favor of data bindings
---

***NOTE***

The datagrid and related functionality has been deprecated as of RmlUi 4.0 and removed in RmlUi 5.0. Instead, users are encouraged to use [data bindings](../data_bindings.html) possibly combined with [RCSS tables](../rcss/tables.html). Similar functionality as previously presented in this tutorial, using a tree structure but instead implemented with data bindings, can be seen in the `treeview` sample.
