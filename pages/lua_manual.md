The documentation for using Lua with RmlUi is a work-in-progress. If you'd like to get started, please have a look at the `luainvaders` sample included with the library.

The Lua implementation works analogous to the old [Python scripting implementation](https://barotto.github.io/libRocketDoc/pages/python_manual.html) in libRocket. It may be helpful to check out its documentation.
